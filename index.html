        <p>Hello my name is Samuel Cardenas i am from Bogota Colombia and i like to swim and play the guitar
            i also love eating my favorite food is the hamburger, actually i am studying french and software engineering
            in BYU Pathway Worldwide and at the same time working using my skills in english. I served a 2 year mission
            in the Ecuador Guayaquil East Mision my favorite thing about the culture was the food they used to prepare
            very good seafood and use the plantain in all their gastronomy but more than that i can say that was a
            experience that grabbed me closer to the Savior and God.
